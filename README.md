# A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM BASED ON SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF REVIEWS FOR INDIA'S HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY.

## Area of Focus
India's healthcare industry has been growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of around 22% since 2016. At this rate, it is expected to reach USD 372 Billion in 2022. 

Healthcare has become one of India’s largest sectors, both in terms of revenue and employment.  The Indian healthcare sector is growing at a brisk pace due to its strengthening coverage, services and increasing expenditure by public as well private players.
With this project we aim to increase the efficiency of  medical system using a recommendation system
 ## Problem Statement 
 Pharmaceutical companies have access to vast amount of data about patients and their reviews for a particular drug available on different pharmaceutical sites. This is a vast amount of data that should be used in a convenient way.  

Moreover, there are drugs, tests, and treatment recommendations (e.g. evidence-based medicine or clinical pathways) available for medical staff every day. Thus, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to decide which treatment to provide to a patient based on her symptoms, test results or previous medical history.



## Proposed Solution
### A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM BASED ON SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF REVIEWS FOR INDIA'S HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY.

A recommendation engine for medical use could be employed to fill this gap and support decision making. Based on a patients' drugs Descriptions, conditions, reviews, the engine can look for the right medicine for patient's condition. With the help of such a system, the doctor will be able to make a better-informed decision on how to treat a patient.


Apart from this, the system can also help pharmaceutical companies to know the success rate of the drug on a particular condition using the reviews of the patient. 

## What our product does?
Our model employs the customers’ surveys to break down their sentiment and suggest a recommendation for their exact need. In our drug recommender system, medicine is offered on a specific condition dependent on patient reviews using sentiment analysis and feature engineering.
